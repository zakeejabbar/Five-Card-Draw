"Five Card Draw"


This is a command line version of the five card draw poker game. The user gets to pick the number of computer opponents to play against (up to 4). Next, the user is dealt five cards and the user can choose to remove up to 3 cards (4 if the user has an Ace). Each computer player also discards its cards from a set algorithm. After the dicard phase, each player's hands are evaluated and the winner is determined.
